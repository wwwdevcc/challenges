# LCD numbers

**Goal:** write a program that displays LCD style numbers.

### Part 1

Write a program that given a number (with arbitrary number of digits), converts it into LCD style numbers using the following format:

```
   _  _     _  _  _  _  _  
 | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|  
 ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|  
  
```

(each digit is 3 lines high)

**Note:** Please do *NOT* read the second part before completing the first. Part of the purpose of this kata is to make you  practice refactoring and adapting to changing requirements.

### Part 2

Change your program to support variable width or height of the digits.
For example for width = 3 and height = 2 the digit 2 will be:

```
 ___
    |
    |
 ___
|
|
 ___
 
```
